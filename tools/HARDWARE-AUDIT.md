# Hardware Audit — bootable USB capture tool

Automatically read a device's hardware (CPU / RAM / storage / serial / battery) and
**save it into a lot** in Als Inventory — even on a wiped, OS-less machine — by
booting it from a Linux USB and running one script.

This is a **collection** tool, not verification. It does **not** check whether a
device was expected or received, or compare serials against any list. It simply
**creates the audited device inside the lot you're working on** (or re-audits it if
the same serial comes through again).

The script runs on **SystemRescue** and on **Ubuntu** live USBs — it detects which
Wi-Fi stack is present (`iwd` on SystemRescue, NetworkManager on Ubuntu) and needs
no `jq` or other extras.

## Workflow

```
Create a lot  →  Select it (Set audit target)  →  Run the script  →  device saved into that lot
```

1. **Create a lot** in the web app (Lots → New Lot), e.g. `BATCH-000020`.
2. **Select the lot** you're auditing into: Lots → **"Set audit target"** on that lot.
   The banner at the top shows the current target. The tool files every audit here
   until you change it.
3. **Run the script** on each device (below). Confirm, and it uploads.

Devices then appear under that lot (expand the lot on the Lots page). Cosmetic grade
and functional tests stay a human call — finish those on the device's page.

## 1. Make the USB (once)

You don't need a custom image — a standard **SystemRescue** or **Ubuntu** live USB is enough.

1. Download **SystemRescue** (`.iso`, systemrescue.org) — or Ubuntu Desktop LTS.
2. Flash it to an 8GB+ USB with **Rufus** (Windows), **balenaEtcher**, or **Ventoy**.
3. Copy **`hardware-audit.sh`** onto the stick, and next to it create an
   **`audit.conf`** with your server, login, **and Wi-Fi** so runs are fully hands-off:
   ```
   AUDIT_URL="https://als-inventory-software-production.up.railway.app"
   AUDIT_EMAIL="you@company.com"
   AUDIT_PASSWORD="your-password"

   # Connected automatically at the start of each run.
   # Leave WIFI_SSID blank if you use wired Ethernet.
   WIFI_SSID="YOUR_WIFI_NAME"
   WIFI_PASSWORD="YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD"
   ```
   Put `audit.conf` in the **root of the USB** (or beside the script) — the tool looks
   in both places, plus the SystemRescue boot mount, automatically.

## 2. Boot the device off the USB

1. Power on and open the **boot menu** (`F12` / `F9` / `Esc` / `F2` by make); pick the USB.
2. If it won't boot, disable **Secure Boot** in BIOS/UEFI and retry.
3. On SystemRescue, let it boot to the default option (root auto-login, text console).

## 3. Run the audit

No network setup needed — the script connects to the Wi-Fi in `audit.conf` itself.

1. Find the stick (SystemRescue auto-mounts USBs under `/run/archiso/bootmnt` or
   `/mnt`). Run it, e.g.:
   ```bash
   bash /run/archiso/bootmnt/hardware-audit.sh
   ```
   (On Ubuntu: `sudo bash /media/*/*/hardware-audit.sh`.)
2. It brings up Wi-Fi (**"Connecting to Wi-Fi …"** → **"Wi-Fi connected."**), reads the
   specs, shows the target lot, then asks **`Start audit into BATCH-000020? [Y/n]`**.
   Press Enter — it uploads and prints **✓ added to BATCH-000020**.

Repeat per machine: shut down, move the USB to the next device, boot, run.

### Optional — run it fully automatically at boot (SystemRescue autorun)

SystemRescue can run a script the moment it boots, so the operator does nothing at all:
name a copy of the script `autorun` in the USB root and boot with the `ar_nowait`
option (Tab/`e` at the boot menu, append `ar_nowait=1`). The script connects Wi-Fi and
audits with no typing. Keep the interactive confirm off for this mode by answering `Y`
by default (it already defaults to Yes on Enter). Most operators prefer the one-command
run above so they can eyeball the specs before uploading.

## What it fills vs. what you finish

The tool captures a **full hardware profile** and stores it verbatim (extensible —
new fields need no software change). Warehouse/manual fields are kept separate and
are **never overwritten** by an audit.

| Filled automatically by the tool | You finish on the device's page |
|---|---|
| Manufacturer, family, model, device type, serial, **Dell express code**, BIOS UUID | Cosmetic grade (A/B/C/D/scrap) |
| BIOS version/date, UEFI/Legacy, Secure Boot, TPM | Functional tests (keyboard, ports, webcam, Wi-Fi…) |
| CPU model/cores/threads/clock, RAM size/type/speed/slots | Data-wipe status + method, disposition |
| Per-drive model/capacity/type/interface/**SMART**/serial | Grade, cost, location, notes, resale value |
| Graphics, battery (design/full/cycle/health), network + MAC | |

Some fields depend on the machine and boot: **OS/build** (usually none — units are
wiped), **BitLocker / BIOS-password state**, and **display EDID** may come back blank.
That's expected — the profile simply omits what it can't read.

### Check a machine without uploading

To see exactly what a device reports (handy for a new model), run:
```bash
AUDIT_DEBUG=1 bash /run/archiso/bootmnt/hardware-audit.sh
```
It prints the captured JSON and exits — no Wi-Fi, no login, no upload.

## Troubleshooting

- **"Could not reach the server over Wi-Fi"** — check `WIFI_SSID` / `WIFI_PASSWORD` in
  `audit.conf` (case-sensitive), that the network is 2.4/5GHz WPA2 (not a captive
  portal), and that the machine has a working Wi-Fi adapter. Plug in Ethernet as a fallback.
- **"No audit lot selected"** — set the target on a lot in the web (step 2), then re-run.
- **Wi-Fi adapter not found** — some laptops need a firmware package not on the live
  image; use a USB Ethernet or a well-supported Wi-Fi dongle.
- **Won't boot the USB** — disable Secure Boot; put USB above the internal disk in boot order.
- **Battery n/a** — expected on desktops.
- **Serial "To be filled by O.E.M."** — the device gets a generated tag; still saved to the lot.

The tool posts to `POST /devices/hardware-audit`. Nothing is stored on the USB beyond
your `audit.conf`; the login is used only to get a token per run.
